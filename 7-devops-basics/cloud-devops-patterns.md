# Cloud-Native DevOps Patterns

## 1. Immutable Infrastructure
Replace servers instead of patching them.

## 2. Infrastructure Pipelines
IaC deploys:
- networks
- security
- logging
- policies

## 3. Policy Gates in CI/CD
Prevent deployments that violate:
- security baselines
- tagging standards
- compliance frameworks

## 4. Automated Testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- IaC tests
