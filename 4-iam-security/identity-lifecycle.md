# Identity Lifecycle Management (Joiner → Mover → Leaver)

Identity lifecycle automation is critical for Zero Trust.

# Joiner (New Hire)
- Auto-create user  
- Assign department-based roles  
- MFA enrollment required  
- Baseline access granted  

---

# Mover (Job Change)
- Remove old access  
- Add new access  
- Validate compliance  
- Check least privilege alignment  

---

# Leaver (Offboarding)
- Disable account immediately  
- Revoke access keys  
- Remove roles/groups  
- Transfer ownership of resources  
- Disable service principals  

---

# Automation Goals
- No manual permission assignment  
- No stale identities  
- No orphaned access

# Summary
Automated identity lifecycle = lower risk + enforcement of Zero Trust.
