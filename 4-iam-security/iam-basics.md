# IAM Basics (AWS + Azure)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) defines which identities can access which cloud resources, using what conditions, and for how long.

IAM is the foundation of all cloud security and Zero Trust models.

# IAM Responsibilities

1. Authentication (prove identity)
2. Authorization (what actions allowed)
3. Accountability (logging & auditing)
4. Delegation (temporary access)
5. Governance (policies & compliance)

# Summary

IAM is the most critical layer of cloud security.  
Strong IAM = reduced breach impact + Zero Trust foundation.
