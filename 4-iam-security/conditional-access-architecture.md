# Conditional Access Architecture (Zero Trust Identity)

Conditional Access decides whether to allow access *based on context*.

---

# Context Signals
- User risk  
- Device compliance  
- Location  
- App sensitivity  
- Session risk  
- Privilege level  
- Authentication strength  

---

# Enforcement Examples
- Require MFA for risky login  
- Block access for non-compliant device  
- Deny high-risk sessions  
- Block access from non-US or unknown countries  
- Require compliant device for admins  

---

# Continuous Access Evaluation
Automatically reevaluate session after:
- Risk increases  
- User changes network  
- Device becomes non-compliant  

---

# Summary
Conditional Access is the core of Zero Trust identity enforcement.
