# Cloud Security + FinOps Playbook

My personal operating manual for cloud security, Zero Trust, IAM, governance, automation, and cost optimization.

I am a Navy veteran, MBA, and cloud/security learner building a career at the intersection of:

- Cloud Security  
- Zero Trust and Identity Governance  
- FinOps and Cloud Cost Management  
- Analytics (Power BI)  
- Cloud Operations and Governance  

This repo is my working playbook — everything I am learning, documenting, and applying as I transition into Cloud Security, IAM, and FinOps.

It includes:

- Practical checklists and reference guides  
- Architecture notes and patterns  
- IAM and identity governance examples  
- FinOps principles, KPIs, and unit economics  
- Cloud cost optimization frameworks  
- Governance and policy-as-code templates  
- Incident response and automation playbooks  
- Hands-on lab guides  
- Power BI and analytics concepts  

This is the blueprint for how I think, learn, and operate in cloud.

## Why This Exists

I am building a long-term cloud career with one mindset:

Small steps. Long vision.

This playbook serves three goals:

1. Replace my supply chain past with a Cloud + Security identity.  
2. Create real, visible artifacts for recruiters and hiring managers.  
3. Build a portfolio I can grow throughout my cloud career.

## My Direction

I am building toward roles in:

- Cloud Security Analyst  
- IAM Engineer / Identity Governance  
- FinOps / Cloud Cost Analyst  
- Cloud Governance / Cloud Operations  

My background in leadership, operations, finance, and the military supports:

- Discipline and accountability  
- Risk assessment and defense-in-depth thinking  
- Structured decision-making  
- Long-term, systems-based thinking  

This repo is a living document. I update it as I:

- Learn new cloud concepts
