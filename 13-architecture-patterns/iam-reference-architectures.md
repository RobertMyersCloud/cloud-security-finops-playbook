IAM Reference Architectures

Identity Patterns:
1. Centralized Identity (Azure AD)
2. Federated Identity (AD > AWS)
3. Multi-Account IAM (AWS)
4. Role-Based Access (Azure)
5. Service Principal / Service Account Access

Best Practices:
- Least privilege roles
- No permanent admin accounts
- Conditional Access and MFA
- Rotate access keys
- Disable unused identities
- Use managed identities or roles, not static credentials
