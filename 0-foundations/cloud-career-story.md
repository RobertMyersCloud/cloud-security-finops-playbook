# Cloud Career Story

I am a U.S. Navy veteran, MBA, and operations leader transitioning into Cloud Security, FinOps, and IT Governance. My background is built on 20 years of military service followed by federal and aerospace operations leadership — all in high-security, compliance-driven environments.

## Background
Throughout my career, I led complex operations involving finance, security, logistics, IT systems, and compliance. I’ve managed multi-million-dollar budgets, overseen classified security operations, and built performance frameworks that improved readiness, data accuracy, and financial transparency.

Key themes in my background:
- Mission-critical operations  
- High-security environments  
- Cost governance & financial control  
- Operational readiness & resilience  
- Leadership of large multi-disciplinary teams  
- Data-driven decision-making  

## Why Cloud + Security + FinOps

Cloud is the modern evolution of everything I’ve done:

### Security
SCIF access, identity verification, access control, RMF — all map directly into IAM, Zero Trust, and cloud security frameworks.

### FinOps
Managing $37M+ budgets, financial forecasting, cost variance, dashboards, and optimization → all directly align with cloud cost governance.

### Cloud Governance
20 years of enforcing DoD/DOJ/Federal standards translates perfectly into cloud policy, compliance, guardrails, and audit readiness.

### Cloud Operations
Global operations, asset tracking, continuity planning, and system oversight match modern cloud ops responsibilities.

## My Goal
To build a cloud career where I combine:
- Security  
- Cost governance  
- Operations  
- Data & analytics  
- Policy & compliance  

This repo documents my transformation into a Cloud Security + FinOps + Governance professional.

**Small steps. Long vision.**
