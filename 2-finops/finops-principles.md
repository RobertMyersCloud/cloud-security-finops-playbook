This document summarizes the core principles defined by the FinOps Foundation and how they apply in real-world cloud cost governance.

## Core Principles

### 1. Teams Need to Collaborate  
FinOps breaks silos across engineering, finance, operations, and leadership.

### 2. Everyone Takes Ownership of Their Cloud Usage  
Teams are accountable for the cost of the resources they deploy.

### 3. A Centralized FinOps Team Drives Best Practices  
They build the dashboards, guardrails, optimization playbooks, and governance structure.

### 4. Decisions Are Driven by Business Value  
FinOps is NOT “cut cost.”  
It is: **optimize cost based on value, performance, and impact.**

### 5. Cloud’s Variable Cost Model Is a Feature  
Use it:
- autoscaling  
- spot instances  
- serverless  
- storage tiering  

### 6. Reports Must Be Timely and Accessible  
Near-real-time reporting is critical to cost governance.

### 7. Take Advantage of the Variable Cost Model  
Flexibility allows scaling **both up and down**.

# Accountability Models

## Showback  
Visibility only (no billing impact).

## Chargeback  
Teams are billed for their cloud usage.

## Hybrid (Most Common)  
Different models per environment/team.

# Unit Economics
Advanced FinOps teams measure:
- cost per customer  
- cost per transaction  
- cost per workload  
- cost per business unit
