# AWS Auto-Remediation Bot (S3 Public Access)

This project automatically detects when an Amazon S3 bucket becomes public and instantly remediates it by enforcing **Block Public Access**. It demonstrates real-world cloud security automation, Zero Trust enforcement, and continuous compliance.

---

## 🔥 Why This Project Matters

Public S3 buckets are one of the **top cloud security risks**.  
This bot solves that by:

- Monitoring all S3 permission changes  
- Detecting public exposure in real time  
- Auto-locking it down  
- Logging every action  

This is exactly how modern cloud security teams automate guardrails at scale.
